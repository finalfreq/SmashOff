# Smash Off

Smash Off was a project for my rails week 4 course at Epicodus. The idea for the app was to create a "hot or not" style site that uses AJAX for instant webpage updates. The idea for our app was to choose which person would win in a fight of smash bros.

## Usage

To run this project you must have rails installed.

Open project in terminal and run bundle to install necessary gems and run the following in terminal.

```
rake db:create
rake db:seed
rake db:migrate
rails s
```

You should then be able to open on localhost:3000. You can then register for an account and create new battles. From there you can vote on any battle.
